# Fraudulent Online Transactions Analysis and Predictive Modeling

Welcome to the repository for the fraudulent online transactions analysis and predictive model for FinTech Bank. As the bank encounters a rising number of online fraud incidents, this project aims to enhance their fraud detection system to safeguard customer transactions and minimize financial losses. This comprehensive analysis delves into the characteristics of fraudulent transactions and evaluates different Machine Learning algorithms to establish the most effective predictive model.

## Materials and Methods

The dataset utilized in this project consists of online transactions, capturing both legitimate and fraudulent activities, divided into three key tables: customers, transactions, and merchants. Our objectives are:

- Transforming disorganized data into formats suitable for analysis.
- Investigating the distribution of normal versus fraudulent transactions.
- Understanding the specific characteristics of fraudulent online transactions.
- Determining the most effective Machine Learning algorithm for predicting fraudulent activities.

We also employ data visualization techniques to enhance the interpretation of our analysis.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the Python script `fraud_detection.ipynb` to start the analysis. This script will import,clean, analyze and visualize the findings from given dataset.

## Project Structure
* `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main Python script for the exploratory data analysis.

* `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
